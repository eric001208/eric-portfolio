        <p>I see architecture as a sequence rather than an object.</p>

        <p>I am interested in how space is revealed over time—through movement, light, compression, and release—rather than how it performs as an image. Architecture, to me, is not a matter of style, but of decisions: what is allowed to enter, what is held back, and how boundaries are negotiated.</p>

        <p>I work from constraints. Limited light, existing structures, narrow sites, and everyday routines are not obstacles but starting points. Design emerges through section, through thickness, through the careful orchestration of proximity and distance.</p>

        <p>I am less concerned with spectacle than with inhabitation. I value spaces that are precise, quiet, and capable of change—spaces that do not announce themselves immediately, but reward attention over time.</p>

        <p>This work is an ongoing inquiry, developed through drawing, making, and testing. Architecture is not a finished statement, but a position continuously revised through practice.</p>
