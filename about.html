        <p>I understand architecture as a logical practice before it is a visual one.</p>

        <p>Beauty does not originate from form itself—whether curved or angular, smooth or irregular—but from the internal logic that gives form necessity. When logic is coherent, elegance emerges naturally.</p>

        <p>I see architecture not as an object, but as a sequence—revealed through time, movement, light, compression, and release. What matters is not how a space performs as an image, but how it unfolds through use. Architecture is less about style than about decisions: what is permitted to enter, what is withheld, and how boundaries are precisely negotiated.</p>

        <p>I work from constraints. Limited light, existing structures, narrow sites, and everyday routines are not problems to overcome, but conditions to think with. Design develops through section, through thickness, and through the careful calibration of distance, proximity, and tolerance.</p>

        <p>I am drawn to a restrained architectural logic—positioned between the determinacy of computation and the freedom of art. Architecture operates in this gray zone, neither purely functional nor purely expressive. It is within this in-between condition that architectural intelligence resides.</p>

        <p>I am less interested in spectacle than in inhabitation. I value spaces that are quiet, exact, and capable of change—spaces that do not announce themselves immediately, but reveal their qualities through sustained attention.</p>

        <p>This work is an ongoing inquiry, developed through drawing, making, and testing. Architecture is not a final statement, but a position—continuously revised as logic meets material, and thought meets use.</p>
